**********************Abstract :********************** 

The central theme of this project is information retrieval, focusing on responding to queries within a specified corpus. While Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are highly capable, they face limitations in processing an entire corpus due to various constraints. Consequently, this project explores methodologies for selective data input and algorithm refinement to improve the efficiency and accuracy of LLM-based information retrieval despite these inherent limitations.

Hence, this can answer queries to a specified document with minimal computation resources ( is not a specific LLM trained for a particular document but something that works on any general document from the get-go)
